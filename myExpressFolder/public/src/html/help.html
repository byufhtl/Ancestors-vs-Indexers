                <p>Ancestors vs Indexers is a free family history game developed by the Brigham Young University Family
                History Technology Lab. The game is designed to provide a fun incentive for people of all ages to get involved
                in their family histories.</p>

                <p>Ancestors vs Indexers provides a way for users to turn their family history work into a game. It uses
                    data obtained from FamilySearch (<a href="https://familysearch.org">familysearch.org</a>) to generate a series of secenarios in which a player
                    must use various kinds of tools and resources to stop their lost ancestors from progressing from one end
                    of the playing field to the other. Data is obtained from FamilySearch according to our Privacy Statement.</p>

                <p>The game simulates the time which we have every day to perform family history work and record our family
                    history before it grows to late. This will require the efforts of many people from many nations, cultures,
                    and ethnic backgrounds.</p>

                    users are required to actually help with the work. Ancestors vs Indexers monitors work done between game sessions
                    on FamilySearch and uses that work to help the player progress. There are many ways to earn points, and
                    a comprehensive list can be found in the guide section.</p>
