# Ancestors-vs-Indexers
Prototype plants vs zombies game with a Family History twist.
Currently just a framework for the game with some cheap and easy graphics powering it.

### Setup

#### Local Development Setup 
After cloning the repository, launch a server from the project's root directory (Ancestors-vs-Indexers by default)
We recommend using pythons' SimpleHTTPServer module to run the server:
    ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer [PORT (optional, default 8000)]```
    
Open your browser to the specified port.
